# Task: NumPy Foundations

## Objective
Manipulate multi-dimensional arrays (tensors).

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create and Reshape
1.  Create an array of numbers from 0 to 23 using `arange`.
2.  Reshape it into a 3D array of shape `(2, 3, 4)`.
3.  Print the shape and dtype.

### Task 2: Image Slicing (Simulation)
Imagine a grayscale image is a 2D matrix of shape `(10, 10)` with random values between 0 and 255.
1.  Generate this random matrix.
2.  Extract the **center** crop of size `(4, 4)` (i.e., rows 3-6, cols 3-6).
3.  Set all pixels in this center crop to 0 (simulate masking). Print the modified matrix.

### Task 3: Conditionals
1.  Create an array of 20 random integers.
2.  Replace all odd numbers with -1.

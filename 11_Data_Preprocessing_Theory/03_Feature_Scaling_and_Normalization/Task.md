# Task: Feature Scaling

## Objective
Normalize a dataset for Machine Learning.

## Data
Create a DataFrame:
*   **Age**: [20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
*   **Salary**: [20000, 30000, 40000, 50000, 1000000] (Note the outlier)

## Tasks
1.  Apply **StandardScaler** to both columns. Report the new Mean and Std Dev (should be ~0 and 1).
2.  Apply **MinMaxScaler**. What is the range of the new data?
3.  Which scaler would be better for this dataset containing a Millionaire? Why?

# Task: Deepfake Disclaimer

## Objective
Transparency.

## Setup
*   You run a political campaign.
*   You use AI to clone the opponent's voice saying \"I love corruption\".
*   This is now illegal in many jurisdictions without a **Watermark** or **Disclaimer**.

## Task
1.  Add a visible watermark: \"Generated by AI\".
2.  Add a metadata watermark: C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity).
    *   Cryptographically sign the file origin.
    *   Twitter/Facebook can check the signature and auto-label it.

## Question
What is 'Right to Erasure'?
*   Answer: GDPR. If a user asks to delete their data, you must delete it. But if the data is already *inside* your Neural Network's weights (memorization), do you have to delete the model? (The law is still fuzzy here, but \"Machine Unlearning\" is a growing field).

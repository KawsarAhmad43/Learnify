# Regulatory Frameworks

## 1. EU AI Act (2024)
The first comprehensive AI law. It classifies AI by **Risk Tier**:
*   **Unacceptable Risk** (Banned): Social Scoring (Black Mirror style), Real-time facial recognition in public (with exceptions).
*   **High Risk** (Regulated): Critical Infrastructure (Transport, Energy), Educational Access (Grading exams), Employee Hiring (CV scanners).
    *   *Requirements*: High quality data, Documentation, Human oversight, Accuracy logging.
*   **Limited Risk** (Transparency): Chatbots.
    *   *Requirements*: Must tell the user "I am an AI".
*   **Minimal Risk**: Spam filters, Video games. (No regulations).

## 2. GDPR (Article 22)
"The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing."
*   **Meaning**: If an AI denies your loan, you have the right to demand a Human Review.

## 3. Copyright (US)
*   **Training**: Is scraping the internet "Fair Use"? (Courts are deciding right now).
*   **Generation**: Who owns the image generated by Midjourney? (Currently: Nobody. Pure AI art cannot be copyrighted).

# Time Series and Image Visualization

## 1. Time Series
Data that changes over time.
*   **Line Chart**: The standard. X-axis is time.
*   **Multiple Lines**: Comparing trends of different entities.
*   **Area Chart**: Good for showing cumulative totals (stacked).
*   **Candlestick Chart**: Specific to finance (Open, High, Low, Close).

## 2. Images
A 2D (grayscale) or 3D (RGB) matrix of pixels.
*   **`imshow`**: Display matrix as an image.
*   **Grid Display**: Showing samples (e.g., 16 MNIST digits in a 4x4 grid).
*   **Channels**: Visualizing R, G, B channels separately.

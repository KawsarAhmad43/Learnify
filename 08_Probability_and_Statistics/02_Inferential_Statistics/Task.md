# Task: Inferential Statistics

## Objective
Apply hypothesis testing to solve business problems.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Store Conversion Rates
You have two versions of a landing page.
*   **Page A**: 1000 visitors, 120 conversions.
*   **Page B**: 1000 visitors, 150 conversions.

1.  Is Page B statistically significantly better than Page A?
2.  Perform a **Chi-Square test** or **Z-test for proportions**.
3.  State your p-value and conclusion at alpha=0.05.

### Task 2: Model Evaluation
You trained two regression models. Their errors (residuals) on the test set (size=50) are provided in the solution notebook (generate random data).

1.  Perform a **Paired T-Test** to see if Model 2 has significantly lower error than Model 1.
2.  Check if the errors are normally distributed using the **Shapiro-Wilk test**.

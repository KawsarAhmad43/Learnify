# AI/ML Engineering Learning Path

Welcome to your guided journey to becoming a strong AI/ML Engineer using Python. This repository is structured to take you from the basics of Python to advanced Deep Learning and MLOps concepts.

## How to Use This Repository

The curriculum is divided into modules (folders). Go through them sequentially.

Each topic folder contains:
1.  **Concept.md**: Read this first to understand the theory.
2.  **Implementation.ipynb**: Run the code to see concepts in action.
3.  **Task.md**: Complete the assigned exercises.
4.  **Solution.ipynb**: Check your work against the provided solutions.

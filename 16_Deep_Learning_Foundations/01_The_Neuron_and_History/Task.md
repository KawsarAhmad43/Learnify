# Task: The Limitations of a Single Neuron

## Objective
Train a Perceptron manually (or using your class) to solve the **XOR** problem and observe why it fails.

## Data (XOR)
*   (0, 0) -> 0
*   (0, 1) -> 1
*   (1, 0) -> 1
*   (1, 1) -> 0

## Tasks
1.  **Create the Dataset**: Define X and y for XOR.
2.  **Try to Train**: Use the `Perceptron` class from the Implementation notebook.
3.  **Visualize**: Plot the 4 points on a 2D graph. Try to draw a single straight line that separates the 0s from the 1s.
4.  **Answer**: Why can't the Perceptron solve this? What do we need to add?

# Qubits and Superposition

## 1. The Bit vs The Qubit
*   **Classical Bit**: 0 OR 1. (Like a light switch).
*   **Quantum Bit (Qubit)**: $\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$. (Like a dimmer switch, or a sphere).
*   $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are basis states (vectors).
*   $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers (Amplitude).
*   $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.

## 2. Superposition
*   A Qubit can be in a state of "Both 0 and 1" at the same time (with specific probabilities).
*   **Power**: With 3 classical bits, you can store ONE number (e.g., 101).
*   With 3 Qubits, you can store ALL 8 numbers (000 to 111) simultaneously in superposition.
*   **Exponential Scaling**: $N$ Qubits = $2^N$ states.
*   300 Qubits = More states than atoms in the universe.

## 3. Measurement
*   When you *look* at a Qubit (Measure it), it collapses to 0 or 1.
*   You lose the superposition.
*   The probability of seeing 0 is $|\alpha|^2$.

# GitHub Workflow

GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. It adds collaboration features like Pull Requests (PRs).

## Authentic Collaboration

### 1. Remote
*   `git remote add origin <url>`: Connect local repo to GitHub.
*   `git push -u origin main`: Upload local commits to GitHub.

### 2. The PR Workflow (Industry Standard)
1.  **Fork** a repository (or clone your team's repo).
2.  Create a **feature branch** locally (`git checkout -b refactor-login`).
3.  Make changes and commit.
4.  **Push** the branch to GitHub (`git push origin refactor-login`).
5.  Open a **Pull Request (PR)** on the website.
6.  Wait for **Code Review** from a peer.
7.  **Merge** the PR once approved.

## Tasks
1.  Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
2.  Create a repository named `learning-ai-path`.
3.  Push your local practice folder to this remote repository.
4.  Create a branch, make a change, push it, and open a PR against your own main branch.

# VSCode for AI Engineering

VSCode is the industry standard editor. It's not just a text editor; it's an IDE.

## Key Setup for AI

### 1. Extensions
Install these immediately:
*   **Python (Microsoft)**: IntelliSense, linting, debugging.
*   **Jupyter**: Run notebooks directly inside VSCode.
*   **Pylance**: High-performance language support.
*   **Remote - SSH**: Critical for connecting to cloud GPU servers (AWS/GCP).

### 2. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
This is your superpower. You can do anything from here.
*   Type "Format Document" to clean up code.
*   Type "Interpreter" to switch Python environments.

### 3. Debugging
Stop using `print()` for everything. Use the Debugger.
*   **Breakpoints**: Click to the left of a line number (red dot). The code will pause there.
*   **Variables View**: See the value of every variable at that exact moment.
*   **Step Over/Into**: Execute code line-by-line.

## Tasks
1.  Install the "Python" and "Jupyter" extensions.
2.  Open a Python file.
3.  Set a breakpoint on a line.
4.  Run "Start Debugging" (F5) and inspect a variable.
